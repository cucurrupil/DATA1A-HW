# SELECTIVE STRUCTURES:
Are used to perform 'decision making' and then branch the program flow based on the outcome of decision making. 

# REPETIVE STRUCTURES: 
Repetition structures, or loops, are used when a program needs to repeatedly process one or more instructions until some condition is met, at which time the loop ends. Many programming tasks are repetitive, having little variation from one item to the next. The process of performing the same task over and over again is called iteration

# NESTED STRUCTURES: 
Structure within structure. One structure can be declared inside other structure as we declare structure members inside a structure. The structure variables can be a normal structure variable or a pointer variable to access the data.

# TYPES OF ALGORITHM REPRESENTATION:
# -GRAPH.
A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.
# -FLOWCHART.
Representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing
# -WRITTEN:PSEUDOCODE.
Writing in pseudocode is similar to writing in a programming language. Each step of the algorithm is written on a line of its own in sequence. Usually, instructions are written in uppercase, variables in lowercase and messages in sentence case.

# CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS:
Constants do not change in value over time. Constants can be any type of number. 
Variables are usually visualized as letters or a phrase, and in certain cases variables can have more than one possible value. Most often variables are used to indicate that a number in an equation or expression is not yet known.

# DISTINGUISH THE TYPES OF COMPUTACIONAL DATA:
# -NUMERIC.
Quantities that can be used to make operations.
# -LOGIC.
Decisions to make between possible answers using equal, and, or less than, greater than 
# -STRING AND CHARACTERS. 
Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
# -ARRANGEMENTS.
It is a set of data or a homogeneous data structure that is located consecutively. 

# TYPES OF COMPUTACIONAL OPERATIONS:

  # ->OPERATORS:
  
# -ARITHMETIC. 
That perform arithmetic operations with numeric operands. 
# -LOGIC. 
Which perform logical operations with bool operands. 
# -RELATIONSHIPS.
That compare numeric operands. 
  
  # ->OPERANDS:
  
# -VARIABLES.
Used in operations, its value can change. a, b
# -CONSTANTS. 
Used in operations, its value cannot change. x, y

 # ->EXPRESSIONS:
 
# -ARITHMETIC. 
Integers or float, real numbers.
# -LOGIC. 
True or False decisions.
